# Overview
This is a web-based quiz application where users can participate in answering questions, and administrators can manage the quiz content by adding and editing questions. The application also tracks users' progress and displays the final score once the quiz is completed.

# Features
* User Mode: Allows users to answer quiz questions and see their scores.
* Admin Mode: Allows administrators to add and manage questions, view results, and clear results.
* Progress Tracker: Shows the user’s progress during the quiz.
* Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.


# How to Use
# Accessing the Admin Session
To access the admin section and manage the quiz questions, follow these steps:

1. On the Start Page, you will be prompted to enter your First Name and Last Name.

2. To access the Admin Panel, enter "**admin**" as both the First Name and Last Name. This will allow you to:

* Add, edit, and remove quiz questions.
* Manage the question list.
3. If the quiz is not ready, you will see the message:

* "Quiz is not ready, please contact the administrator."
This message appears if the admin session hasn’t been set up, so only admins will be able to configure the quiz.

4. Once the correct admin credentials are entered, you will be able to navigate to the Admin Panel to start setting up questions for the quiz.

# Regular User Mode
* As a regular user, simply enter your name (do not enter "admin") and begin answering quiz questions.
* Once you’ve completed the quiz, your score will be displayed on the results page.
  
# Clearing Results
Admins can also clear the result list by navigating to the results panel and selecting the "Clear Results" button.
